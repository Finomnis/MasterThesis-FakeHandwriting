    - Introduction, Master Thesis 'Making offline handwriting editable'
        - Offline handwriting vs online handwriting
            - Online:
                - temporal data reduces ambiguity for NN
                - needs specific recording device
            - Offline:
                - every text can be converted to offline
                - missing temporal data creates ambiguity
                - double lines disappear
                - style now also includes pen and paper
                - increased noise
        - editable - being able to generate new text in given style

    - Why?
        - Typed text clearly has advantages:
            * editability
            * compressability
            * comparable and searchable
        - Written text also has advantages:
            * form of art
            * identifies its writer
            * positive impact on short and long term memory
        - Combining benefits of handwritten text with the versatility and efficiency of digital text
        - Automated handwriting generation, like for example banks
        - Because we can, and it's cool
        - Primarily: New, no one has done it yet,
                     Getting new insights into neural networks + handwritten text
                    - Gain deeper understanding in similarities and differences between human and machine text perception
                    - Find new possibilities conc. machine and text interaction

- Existing research
    - Graves
    - DeepWriting

- Pipeline
    - Skeleton generation
    - Preproc   essing
    - Creation of artificial pen positions
    - DeepWriting
    - Style Transfer

- Details
    - Skeleton generation
        - Handwritten Chinese Characters, Wang and Liu
        - use existing network like VGG/Resnet
        - take specific layer outputs
        - upscale, concatenate and filter
        - have to implement and train on western handwriting

    - Preprocessing, Creation of pen positions
        - Problem: missing information in offline:
            - Order of lines
            - Which side of line start/end
            - Distance of samples
        - Doesn't have to be identical to human, just consistent enough that the network understands it
        - THIS IS WHAT I CURRENTLY WORK ON
            - preprocessing: graph creation, cleanup, merging of crossections
            - pure constant-length segmentation doesn't seem to work
            (- try to go reverse
                instead of samples from skeleton
                -> use real online data and abstract)
            - max acceleration sampling?
        - entire master thesis depends on this

    - Deepwriting
        - As previously explained

    - Generation of realistic images
        - Pix2Pix
        - Generic framework to map images from one style to another
        - styles can be very different
        - EXAMPLES
        - closest one to my usecase: handbag: edges to images
        - hopefully this will work

- Open Questions
    - 1,2,3
    - 4: Style Transfer
        - Make the output match the input style
        - Hard
        - Potential future work, depending on the time frame
