    - Thesis name (offline vs online)
    - Motivation
    - Goals of this thesis

- Pipeline Overview

- Stage 1: Skeletonization
    - Overview Slide
    - Pix2Pix background
        - Usage Examples
        - Requirements (Pairwise annotations)
        - U-Net
        - L1 Loss benefit
    - CycleGan
        - Usage Examples
        - Advantages vs Pix2Pix (No pairwise annotations) -> Cycle consistency
        - Cycle Consistency details
    - CycleGAN Experiment
        -> Failure image
        - Reasons
    - Knowledge Transfer
    - Pix2Pix Experiment
        - Knowledge transfer steps
    - Existing Problems

- Stage 2: Conversion to Online
    - Overview Slide
    - Graph Refinement
        - Step by step. Maybe animation of a complex example
    (- Maybe quick slide about missing details: Cycle breaking, ordering)
    - Resampling: Constant Velocity
    - Resampling: Max Acceleration
        - 4D Djikstra => Rough math outline, nice animation
    - Real results image

- Stage 3: Writer Style Transfer
    - Overview Slide
    - Graves Background
    - DeepWriting Background (briefly)
    - DeepWriting Experiment
        - Constant Velocity vs Max Acceleration
    - Graves Experiment:
        - Success
    - Train with Real Skeletons vs Reskeletonized
    - Different Styles Demonstration
    - Existing Problems

- Stage 4: Pen Style Transfer
    - Overview Slide
    - Modifying pix2pix
        - Style extractor,
    - Modifying depth and channels, assymmetric unet
    - Results

- Stage 5: Background Style Transfer
    - Overview Slide
    - SPADE background
    - Conditional Pix2pix vs SPADE
    - Multi-Step
        - Overview + Talk about it a little

- Conclusion
    - Goals of this thesis
    - Future Work
